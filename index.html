                <p><strong>Flora</Strong><br>There are today nearly 14000 plants of some varieties, including woody trees and a wealth of herbs and shrubs. Planted in several phases over the years, these have not just created a patch of urban green but veritable forest of life. Also, several plants occurring in this region seems to be spreading here their own. Some of the trees like Hirada, Behada, Amala, Arujn, Kadunimb, Baniyan, Fig, Palas and many more are planted in the Park.</p>

                <p><strong>Reptiles & Amphibians</Strong><br>Reptiles were living on this land right from the time when it was the landfill site. Feeding on the rodents living on the landfill site, snakes became an integral part of Fairytale Forest ecology along with the process of it becoming woodland. Some crawled in here from the adjoining mangrove forest area and few were brought in from the city to set then free here. Food, shelter and opportunities to live made their succession possible here and today all them are hissing here successfully. Feeding on insects, lizards, frogs, rodents and small birds most of the reptiles at Fairytale Forest have become a part an integral part of the food chain here. Being cold-blooded animals mostly they are seen basking in sun during the winters. Rat snakes, Russel’s viper, Sand boa, besides most of the species of lizards and geckos. Out of the big four venomous snakes of India, Fairytale Forest has breeding population of Common Indian Cobra and Russel’s viper.</p>

                <p><strong>Spiders</Strong><br>Being man-made woodland,is also a host to a variety of animals living in woodland. Spiders holds a reputation of scary, ugly and creepy animal and hence most ignored and feared. By understanding its role in ecosystem and knowing about all its aspects will fascinate us. A powerful predator, a skilled hunter and a good ambusher, it is keeping our surrounding clean, eating the mosquitoes and other pests and keeping their population under control.

                    Fairytale Forest has many varieties of spiders living in different habitats like burrows, in bushes, on the tree etc. the data collected over a period of times shows that there are about 30 species of spiders belonging to 11 families recorded here. Feeding on tiny and small insects and being food for other animal like birds and reptiles (mainly the lizards) etc., the spiders is an important group of animals in web of life of the Maharashtra Nature Park. Some of the species of spider found in Fairytale Forest are Lynx spider, Wolf spider, Garbage lining spider, Crab spider.</p>

                <p><strong>Mammals</Strong><br>The mammals regularly reported from here include species of bats and rodents. The striped squirrels can be sighted regularly. Small bands of flying fox, the largest of our bats, mat be seen visiting fruiting Ficus and Mast trees. The various palms in the nursery area are a roosting site for smaller bats, that includes short-nosed and fulvous fruits-bats.</p>

                <p><strong>Birds</Strong><br>The scarcity of space and greed for natural resources by humans is pushing the birds to the brink of extinction. Balancing between the development and the needs of wildlife has never been easy. Development activities have significantly increased in recent years and have greatly impacted both the diversity and density of birds in all landscapes especially in urbanised areas. Creating green islands like Wonder Land, is therefore became necessity to save them. An effort like this has helped not only for the adaptable urban birds but also for the migrants that stop over during their long journeys.

                    Surrounded by Mithi river estuary on one side and thickly populated urbanisation on the other, Fairytale Forest is home to more than 125 species of birds as per the recent records, i.e. almost 10 % of the total species found in India. While there is a notable presence of scavenging and those feeding on insects (insectivorous), Fairytale Forest also has good presence of frugivorous birds. The large green area and the location of the park is such that even uncommon species are recorded. Some of the bird species are: Common Tailor Bird, Indian Paradise Flycatcher, Asian Koel, Cattle Egret, Common Myna, Kingfisher, Rose-ringed Parakeet, Purple-rumped Sunbird, Coppersmith Barbet and White Spotted Fantail Flycatcher.</p>

                <p><strong>Butterfly!</Strong><br>For most of us introduction to wilderness starts with running behind butterflies which are seen around our homes, parks or gardens. They fascinate us with the bright colours, their wonderful shapes and with their flights around the bushes laden with flowers. At Wonder Land, monitoring of butterflies was started with the first ever survey carried out in the year 1997-98 which resulted into data of 34 varieties being recorded, after careful observation and detailed research today the total count has reached to 85 species. Creation of Butterfly Park project was also very instrumental in conservation of Butterflies at Wonder Land. Some of the Butterfly Species are:Blue Mormon, Common Crow, Common Palmfly, Palin Tiger, Blue Tiger, Striped Tiger, Common Jay, Common Mormon, Chocolate Pansy, Common Jezebel.</p>
